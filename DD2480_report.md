# Report for assignment 3

## Project

**Name:** Scrapy

**URL:** [https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy)

**Description:** *An open source and collaborative framework for extracting the data you need from websites. In a fast, simple, yet extensible way.*


## Onboarding experience

How easily can you build the project? Brieï¬‚y describe if everything worked as documented or not:

**(a) Did you have to install a lot of additional tools to build the software?**  
No. Only standard Python tools (like pip) were needed. For testing [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/index.html) was needed and to automatically address simple code issues before every commit [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) was needed.

**(b) Were those tools well documented?**  
Yes. The required tools are well documented on the contribution guide with links to the respective tools. It could have been helptful with a summary of tools needed to get started those tools needed to be installed individually and the information was a little bit spread out in the contribution documentation.

**(c) Were other components installed automatically by the build script?**  
Yes. Dependencies are automatically handled via the build configuration.

**(d) Did the build conclude automatically without errors?**  
Yes. The build process completed automatically without errors.

**(e) How well do examples and tests run on your system(s)?**  
The examples and tests run smoothly on supported systems.


## Complexity

#### 1. What are your results for five complex functions?
* `_next_request` got a CCN of 11 with manual counting using the formula $\pi-n+2$ while lizard got a CCN of 13. However, lizard caluclates the CCN by amount of decisions plus one. Using that formula with manual counting yield the same result of 13.
* `run` got a cyclomatic complexity of 14 using the radon tool, which uses the formula 1 + number of decisions. By using the same formula, the complexity was calculated by hand to be 14 as well. 
* `func`
* `func`
* `func`
#### 2. Are the functions just complex, or also long?
All of the functions are only moderatly complex and for the most part also fairly short. There isn't a clear correlation between the CCN and NLOC.

#### 3. What is the purpose of the functions?
* `_next_request`: This function handles scheduling requests and error handling. It gets a bit complex because it has to manage several control flows and exceptions, which is just part of its job.
* `run`: The run function loads and executes contract tests for spiders. It gets complex due to it handling both contract-tested methods and contract-based spider tests. 
* `func`
* `func`
* `func`

#### 4. Are exceptions taken into account in the given measurements?
Yes, lizard and Radon counts exceptions. Each except clause is considered a branch, thus increasing the cyclomatic complexity.

#### 5. Is the documentation clear w.r.t. all the possible outcomes?
The documentation explains the general behavior but could be improved to detail the outcomes of each branch. For many of the functions there are barely any docstrings or comments describing the code and different branching in the functions.


## Refactoring

Plan for refactoring complex code:

Estimated impact of refactoring (lower CC, but other drawbacks?).

Carried out refactoring (optional, P+):

git diff ...

## Coverage

### Tools

Document your experience in using a "new"/different coverage tool.

How well was the tool documented? Was it possible/easy/difficult to
integrate it with your build environment?

### Your own coverage tool

Show a patch (or link to a branch) that shows the instrumented code to
gather coverage measurements.

The patch is probably too long to be copied here, so please add
the git command that is used to obtain the patch instead:

git diff ...

What kinds of constructs does your tool support, and how accurate is
its output?

### Evaluation

1. How detailed is your coverage measurement?

2. What are the limitations of your own tool?

3. Are the results of your tool consistent with existing coverage tools?

## Coverage improvement

Show the comments that describe the requirements for the coverage.

Report of old coverage: [link]

Report of new coverage: [link]

Test cases added:

git diff ...

Number of test cases added: two per team member (P) or at least four (P+).
